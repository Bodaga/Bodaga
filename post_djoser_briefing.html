    <h1>APA FILE: APA INTERNAL BRIEFING</h1>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Post-Djoser Incident Debrief<br>
       <strong>Division:</strong> Arcane Threat Assessment Unit<br>
       <strong>Clearance Level:</strong> Yellow 3<br>
       <strong>Date:</strong> D+3 Post-Event<br>
       <strong>Compiled by:</strong> Agent M. Keene, Special Analysis Division</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Executive Summary:</h2>
    <p>Following the unauthorized intrusion at the Djoser Locus Site, the primary four anomalous individuals referred to as <strong>“STONEHENGE”</strong> (see Ref: STONEHENGE-01) are confirmed to have <strong>entered the pyramid</strong>, bypassed <strong>Order of the Veil surveillance</strong>, and engaged in combat with an embedded <strong>Sons of Aether detachment</strong> led by now-deceased operative <strong>Luther Morrigan</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Analysis suggests that despite prior <strong>hostile engagement with APA operatives</strong> and consistent evasion of surveillance, the group <strong>actively opposed the SoA</strong> at the Locus and <strong>repaired the ritual circle</strong>, counter to the SoA's destabilization directive.</p>

    <p>This action has disrupted standard threat alignment models. Their actions cannot be reliably categorized under any currently monitored hostile faction.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Point of Entry:</strong> Stonehenge arrived on-site under SoA escort. [REDACTED] confirmed initial cooperation with Luther Morrigan.</li>
      <li><strong>Separation Event:</strong> Stonehenge diverged from SoA escort during the tomb access phase. [REDACTED] states “they refused to share findings.”</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement Timeline:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Magical activity surge recorded at 19:42 local time.</li>
          <li>Internal monitoring registered <strong>brief destabilization of the veil</strong>, followed by immediate stabilization.</li>
          <li>Spectral aurora noted over the site by Order observers.</li>
          <li>Luther Morrigan yet to be recovered.</li>
          <li>Ritual Circle yet to be accessed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Survivors:</strong> Two SoA operatives fled and were apprehended by APA agents.
        <ul>
          <li>Both testified to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Hostile engagement with the Stonehenge.</li>
            <li>Circle was actively being interacted with by Stonehenge to unknown ends.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subject Profiles (Updated):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wilhelm:</strong> Wizard-class anomaly. Unknown origin.</li>
      <li><strong>Apollo:</strong> Sorcerer-class anomaly. Suspected link to ancestral magical lineage.</li>
      <li><strong>Bud E. Holly:</strong> Druidic class anomaly. History of anti-institutional rhetoric.</li>
      <li><strong>Shirley Nesbitt:</strong> Paladin-class anomaly. Claims Christian divine conduit status. Known to inspire cult-like loyalty among civilians. Unclear if contact is genuine or anomalous mimicry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assessment:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “They don’t work for the Sons, they fight us, and they don’t share Order ideology either. That means they’re working toward something else entirely — either they don’t trust anyone, or they’re trying to claim the circles for themselves.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>The primary hypothesis emerging is that the Stonehenge represent a <strong>self-directed faction</strong>, whose motives are not yet fully understood. Their <strong>protection of the ritual structure</strong> is anomalous and potentially strategic — perhaps to <strong>control or monopolize</strong> access to ambient magical build-up for their own ends.</p>

    <p>Secondary hypotheses include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third-party agents from the other side acting to exert control over our world.</li>
      <li>Order agents gone off-the-books.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MEASURES:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate reclassification</strong> of the Stonehenge as <strong>High-Priority Unaligned Magical Threats</strong>.</li>
      <li>Deploy Surveillance Teams to [REDACTED].</li>
      <li>Recover access to Djoser site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
    <p>The circle remains intact. Whether by choice or chance, they preserved the veil. The question is why.</p>
