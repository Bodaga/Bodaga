      <h3>Summary of Incident</h3>
      <p>
        At approximately [REDACTED] hours, APA Team VIOLET-12 encountered Subject Group STONEHENGE while en route to analyze anomalous necrotic emissions near a compromised village reservoir. 
        Subjects initiated hostilities without verbal warning, employing advanced magical effects consistent with multiple Class-IV and Class-V threat signatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group disabled two research operatives and forced full extraction of Recon Team assets. No fatalities recorded, but neurological damage sustained by one technician is under evaluation for permanent cognitive interference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interference with monitoring drones and thaumaturgic sensors suggests intentional disruption. One classified artifact container was breached during the conflict; contents remain unaccounted for.
      </p>

      <h3>Current Threat Assessment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Group STONEHENGE remains at large.</strong> Escape presumed via arcane teleportation matrix.</li>

        <li>All local APA assets ordered to operate under shadow deployment rules until further notice.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Recommended Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Elevate surveillance across known teleportation vectors and leyline-active regions.</li>
        <li>Deploy counter-summoning rig to all mobile teams in Cambodian Highlands.</li>
        <li>Update internal threat profiles for all four subjects. Coordination with Intelligence & Analysis ongoing.</li>
