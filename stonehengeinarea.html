        <h3>Summary of Incident</h3>
        <p>At approximately [REDACTED] hours, APA Team VIOLET-12 encountered Subject Group STONEHENGE while en route to analyze anomalous necrotic emissions near a compromised village reservoir. Subjects initiated hostilities without verbal warning, deploying advanced magical effects consistent with Class-IV and Class-V threat profiles.</p>
        <p>The group disabled two research operatives and forced full extraction of recon assets. While no fatalities were reported, one technician sustained neurological damage currently under evaluation for long-term cognitive interference.</p>
        <p>Monitoring drones and thaumaturgic sensors experienced heavy disruption, suggesting premeditated counter-surveillance. A classified artifact container was breached during the incident; contents remain unaccounted for.</p>
