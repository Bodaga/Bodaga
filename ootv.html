  <h1>APA INTELLIGENCE & ANALYSIS DIVISION</h1>
  <h2>ACTIVE THREAT DOSSIER</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">THREAT NAME:</div>
    Order of the Veil (OotV)
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">CLASSIFICATION:</div>
    Monitored Entity – Tier 2 | Cooperative Anomalous Organization
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">SUMMARY:</div>
    The "Order of the Veil" is an ancient, extra-governmental entity with global reach and unknown founding origin, believed to predate the APA by centuries—possibly millennia. First recorded interaction with APA assets occurred in 1953, though references to similar operatives exist as far back as the 18th century in various suppressed magical records. Despite its opaque structure and archaic internal systems, the Order demonstrates persistent operational continuity and access to anomalous knowledge.

    The OotV is explicitly dedicated to the **containment and suppression of arcane phenomena**, often overlapping with APA field interests. While not directly aligned with APA doctrine or jurisdiction, the Order has historically demonstrated a cooperative stance, frequently relaying magical incident data (often pre-filtered) to APA front channels.

    Their preference for **minimal mobilization of internal forces** and quiet handovers to APA Operations makes their presence tolerable. However, their **refusal to fully disclose internal leadership**, coupled with a demonstrated capacity for sustained secrecy and deep ritual knowledge, raises continued counterintelligence concerns.

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">STRUCTURE (Known):</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Council of the Veil</strong> – Believed to be governing authority. Number of seats, identities, or selection criteria remain unconfirmed.</li>
      <li><strong>Knight Captain</strong> – Senior-most known field commander. Directs "Warband" deployments, including force projection and ritual countermeasures. All Knight Captains identified to date have rotated out or died without known successor confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Adherents</strong> – Term used for low-visibility field agents, messengers, and arcane custodians. Often serve as liaisons to APA or act as intermediaries in shared-op zones.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">NOTABLE INTERACTIONS:</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>UK 2004 –</strong> Alerted APA to a failed ritual site in Yorkshire. Minimal local fallout due to pre-emptive OotV sealing.</li>
      <li><strong>Greenland 1981 –</strong> Recovered anomalous relic handed off to APA via neutral intermediary. Metadata scrubbed.</li>
      <li><strong>Egypt 2025 –</strong> Indirect assistance rendered during SoA incursion at [REDACTED]. APA field report notes Veil presence on site but no direct communication logged.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">INFILTRATION STATUS:</div>
    Multiple failed attempts. No APA asset embedded beyond superficial contact roles. Veil appears structurally immune to conventional HUMINT infiltration. Possible thaumaturgic obfuscation or vetting mechanisms in play.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="label">CURRENT APA POSITION:</div>
    <strong>Tolerated, monitored, not actively obstructed.</strong><br><br>
    As long as the Order of the Veil maintains its posture of passive support and non-obstruction, no direct engagement is advised. Intelligence Division maintains open channels for incident reporting. However, elevated suspicion remains due to:
    <ul>
      <li>Refusal to disclose command hierarchy.</li>
      <li>Unknown funding/armament sources.</li>
      <li>Confirmed possession of Class-A ritual knowledge predating APA catalogues.</li>
    </ul>
    All field agents instructed to document any Veil contact immediately. Do not engage without prior clearance from Division Lead or on-site Operations Commander.
