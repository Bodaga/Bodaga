<h1>APA RESEARCH BRIEF – CROSS-PLANAR PHYSICS INTERSECTIONS</h1>
<section>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Cross-planar physics intersections refer to points where the physical laws of our baseline reality interact or overlap with those of adjacent planes. These intersections create instability zones prone to veil breaches, anomalous energy surges, and unintended entity crossings.</p>
<p>The APA’s Theoretical Thaumatology teams monitor these phenomena to predict, contain, and neutralize potential incursions and prevent structural degradation of the local reality envelope.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>CURRENT UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planar Membrane Theory:</strong> Our dimension is separated from adjacent planes by a thin but resilient membrane, which can rupture under high-energy magical events.</li>
<li><strong>Leyline Nexus Vulnerability:</strong> Cross-planar intersections occur most frequently at leyline nexuses and near ritual circles.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency Resonance Windows:</strong> Certain spells/artifacts resonate with planar frequencies, creating micro-fissures between realities.</li>
<li><strong>Gravitational & Temporal Displacement:</strong> Overlaps can cause time dilation and spatial warping, complicating containment.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>THREATS IDENTIFIED</h2>
<ul>
<li>Uncontrolled summoning events and unintended entity crossings.</li>
<li>Ambient mana spikes creating rogue spellcasting risk.</li>
<li>Destabilized ritual circles acting as planar funnels.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>APA POSITION</h2>
<p>Cross-planar intersections represent significant threats to global stability. APA research priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global mapping of intersection points.</li>
<li>Development of frequency dampeners and sealant fields.</li>
<li>Operations Division training for field neutralization of active intersections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The APA is committed to preserving the integrity of baseline reality against external planar interference.</p>
